## Experience

### Data Engineer
**John Deere** (Agriculture/Manufacturing) | Apr 2021 - Current

- Led migration of ML model serving infrastructure from AWS SageMaker to Databricks, reducing infrastructure costs and operational overhead; established Databricks as the standard deployment target for all new models while incrementally migrating existing endpoints.
- Designed and developed high-throughput ML inference API handling 2,000+ requests/sec using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and SageMaker; enabled new recurring revenue streams for precision agriculture products.
- Codified ML infrastructure deployments using Terraform and GitHub Actions, managing IAM policies, Unity Catalog permissions, and service principal configurations to enable repeatable, auditable production deployments.
- Overhauled observability for ML inference endpoints after a production outage went unnoticed, refactoring error handling, reconfiguring Datadog dashboards for clearer visibility, and adding real-time alerts to prevent recurrence.
- Developed reusable GitHub Actions for secure AWS Secrets Manager integration with OIDC authentication, standardizing credential management across the team's data engineering repositories and enabling adoption by other engineering teams.
- Designed onboarding project and technical roadmap for an Engineering Development Program mentee, breaking down their first endpoint migration into structured stories covering CI/CD, Terraform, and Databricks deployment patterns.

**Awards:**
- *2025* - Quarterly Award: ML inference infrastructure classifying machine state at 150k+ requests/min.
- *2023* - Quarterly Award: ML API enabling machine state classification for equipment without onboard display technology.
- *2022* - Quarterly Award: Data pipeline to filter training data potentially regulated by international privacy laws.

### Data Engineer
**Team Rubicon** (Disaster Response Non-profit) | Mar 2019 - Feb 2021

- Developed analytical pipeline to quantify financial impact of volunteers over 300+ disaster operations; secured $200k donation.
- Leveraged GIS to map and prioritize disaster relief needs by combining CDC Social Vulnerability Index with operational data.
- Migrated data analytics platform from Palantir Foundry to Azure; enabled organization-wide access to more data analytics tools.
- Mentored two junior analysts on Power BI and SQL; doubled data engineering capacity and reduced requests for ad-hoc analyses.

**Awards:**
- *2021* - [Esri Special Achievement in GIS](https://events.esri.com/conference/sagList/?fa=List&awardyear=2021)
- *2019* - U.S. President's Volunteer Service Award with special commitment to Disaster Response Services.

### Data Analyst, Developer Advocate (contract)
**Kaggle** (Data Science Competitions) | Jun 2017 - Mar 2019

- Partnered with the NFL to develop [NFL First and Future](https://www.nfl.com/causes/1st-and-future/), a crowd-sourced competition to improve player safety through data science.
- Created a new competition format with non-profit partners, driving an 8% increase in competition launches in 2018.

### Software Engineering Intern
**Smashrun** (Fitness Analytics) | Sept 2016 - Dec 2016

- Developed a data pipeline for processing geojson data into map tiles and generating geospatial visualizations of user running activity.

### Bioinformatics Engineering Intern
**Adaptive Biotechnologies** (Biotech) | May 2016 - Sept 2016

- Developed bioinformatics tool with Python and R to automate chi-square testing of DNA sequencing data for sample independence.
- Automated statistical reporting and generating scientific publication-ready data visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### Aircraft Electrical and Environmental Specialist
**United States Air Force** | Dec 2005 - Dec 2009

- Trained airmen on aircraft maintenance and safety, achieving 100% success in quality assurance and zero injuries over two years.
- Maintained electrical and avionics systems on C-130 and MQ-9 aircraft, ensuring mission readiness for fleets valued at over $500M.
- Participated in Exercise Balikatan, the annual U.S.-Philippines military exercise focused on counterterrorism operations, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief, maintaining aircraft readiness for combined training operations.
- Supported Operation Christmas Drop, the world's longest-running humanitarian airdrop mission, maintaining aircraft systems for Pacific Air Forces training operations delivering essential supplies to remote Pacific island communities.
- Collaborated with Japanese Air Self-Defense Forces on joint maintenance operations, facilitating knowledge exchange and strengthening international partnerships.

## Interests

- **Autonomous Rover:** I am building an autonomous rover to deliver homebrew to my neighbors ([blog post](https://crawforc3.github.io/blog/rover))
- **Homebrewing beer:** I have been homebrewing beer for over 15 years and I even brewed beer professionally for a couple of years.
- **3D printing:** I use OnShape to create 3D models for the various projects I am working on. I have designed, modeled, and printed tools for homebrewing, biodegradable seed starters, and parts for my autonomous rover ([Printables](https://www.printables.com/@crawforc3))
- **Self-hosting and Homelab:** I maintain a 3-node cluster of servers in my basement where I use Proxmox for virtualization and high availability. I host my own servers for Gitea (GitHub alternative), games, VPNs, and various other services.
- **Kaggle:** I am a Kaggle Grandmaster and was the world's first Kaggle Datasets Grandmaster ([profile](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford))
